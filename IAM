day2:-
AWS-IAM -identity and access management control
Note-in organization-never use the root account

IAM-in the aws , IAM maintain to do authentication and authorization.
if when consumer or user want to access the service. the devops do the task. we can select the service that consumer can access[read or wright] or not. its will work on based on the polices company providerd or requirement.

IAM HAVE THE FOUR THING TO GIVE THE ACCESS.
-USER
-polices
-groups
-roles

we need to create the user and set the polices[user and policez]
issue:
when the user or employ join and resgin. its will take every time 2 to 3hour to set the user and polices. 
to resolve this we have come up with the groups.

we have the groups
1.QA
2.DEVEloper
3.admin
4.dbadmin
when the user come to the company and based on the roles. we just need to add into that group.

roles:
roles are similer to the user. its mean to be use for tempveroy purpose to access the service.
when we communicate between the two aws account. and when we use the outside of IAM activitys.

Polices:-
custom policies-provide by aws
private policies- created by company's or devops team.
